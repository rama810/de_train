## What is mod this about?

<p align=justify>
This mod is focused on production and transportation, also units. And the main reason (also the main thing) about this mod is the trains. I'm planning on creating pylon-like thing that has cables for the train to move on. But it's going to be on the low-priority since 6.0 hasn't released and I need to learn about JavaScript more. </p>

## Note

This mod is in still development. The sprites that you see are just temporary sprites, there will be a permanent replacement for them soon (hopefully).

_~~Like it's going to be developed anyway~~_

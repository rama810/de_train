## What is mod this about?

<p align=justify>
This mod is focused on production and transportation, also units. And the main reason (also the main thing) about this mod is the trains. I'm planning on creating pylon-like thing that has cables for the train to move on. But it's going to be on the low-priority since 6.0 hasn't released and I need to learn about JavaScript more. </p>

## Note

This mod is in still development. The sprites that you see are just temporary sprites, there will be a permanent replacement for them soon (hopefully). Ignore the commits, or click [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdQw4w9WgXcQ&ved=2ahUKEwjMuKvG0IXpAhWaeisKHa3FDtYQ3ywwAnoECBUQIQ&usg=AOvVaw0aHtehaphMhOCAkCydRLZU)

_~~Like it's going to be developed anyway~~_
